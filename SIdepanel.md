Project Overview: This project is a specialized text editor for transcripts, likely called "PaperCut". It allows for word-level editing and organization of transcripts, with features like speaker identification, block-based content management, and custom cursor handling.

Key Components:

a. PaperCutPanel (Right Side):

Main component for displaying and editing transcripts.
Manages tabs for different transcripts.
Renders the PapercutEditor for each active tab.
b. PaperCutSidebar (Left Side):

Displays a tree structure of all transcripts and folders.
Allows for organization and navigation of transcripts.
c. PapercutEditor:

Core editing component for individual transcripts.
Handles word-level interactions and custom cursor positioning.
d. EditorBlock:

Represents a block of text, typically grouped by speaker.
Renders individual words and handles word-level interactions.
Data Structures:

a. ContentItem: Represents a single word in the transcript with metadata.

interface ContentItem {
  word: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  wordIndex: number;
  segmentId: string;
  segmentStartTime: number;
  segmentEndTime: number;
  speaker: string;
  fileName: string;
  fileId: string;
}
b. Block: Represents a group of ContentItems, typically by the same speaker.

interface Block {
  id: string;
  items: ContentItem[];
  speaker: string;
}
c. PaperCutTab: Represents a tab in the editor.

interface PaperCutTab {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  type: 'file' | 'folder';
  editorState: ContentItem[] | null;
  active: boolean;
  createdAt: number;
  order: number;
  parentId: string | null;
}
Context and State Management:

a. PaperCutContext:

Manages the overall state of the application.
Handles tab creation, deletion, and content updates.
Provides functions like createTab, updateTabContent, setActiveTab, etc.
b. EditorContentContext:

Manages the state of selected content across the application.
c. ActiveEditorContext:

Manages the state of the currently active editor.
Provides functions to interact with the active editor.
Key Functions:

a. In PapercutEditor:

handlePaste: Handles pasting content into the editor.
handleKeyDown: Manages key presses, including Enter for splitting blocks.
handleWordClick: Manages cursor positioning when a word is clicked.
b. In PaperCutContext:

createTab: Creates a new tab.
updateTabContent: Updates the content of a specific tab.
setActiveTab: Sets the active tab.
moveTab: Moves a tab in the hierarchy.
c. In PaperCutSidebar:

handleItemClick: Manages selection and activation of items in the sidebar.
handleDragStart, handleDragOver, handleDrop: Manage drag-and-drop functionality.
Custom Cursor Implementation:

The editor uses a custom cursor implementation instead of the default text cursor.
Cursor position is managed through state (cursorPosition) and rendered as a custom element.
Styling:

The project likely uses a CSS-in-JS solution or a CSS framework for styling.
Custom styles are applied for the editor, blocks, words, and cursor.
Performance Considerations:

The editor likely uses virtualization or pagination for handling large transcripts efficiently.
Accessibility:

ARIA attributes are used to enhance accessibility, especially in the EditorBlock component.
Future Improvements:

Implement undo/redo functionality if not already present.
Enhance the custom cursor implementation for better visibility and user experience.
Optimize performance for very large transcripts.
Implement more advanced text editing features if required.
